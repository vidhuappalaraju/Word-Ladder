# Word-Ladder

A word ladder is a sequence of distinct words where each word in the sequence is followed by a word that can be created by changing one letter. Each word in the sequence should be a real word in the dictionary. An example of a word ladder is:

    smart
    start
    stars
    soars
    socks
    cocks
    conks
    cones
    coney
    money

If a word ladder does not exist between the start word and end word, then it will output a message to the console saying that no word ladder can be found. 

In this project, I created a word ladder between two words using breadth first search and depth first search. The breadth first search was implemented using a queue and the depth first search was implemented using recursion.
